			<p class=par>The iPhone 5C lacks several major new features introduced in the iPhone 5S; the 5C uses the A6 chip instead of the A7 with motion co-processor, does not include Touch ID, does not support OpenGL ES 3.0, and lacked the Burst iSight camera mode and slow-motion video recording mode. Instead, the iPhone 5C uses much of the same internal hardware of its predecessor, the iPhone 5. However the iPhone 5C uses a hard-coated polycarbonate casing (eschewing the aluminum used by the iPhone 5), along with a standard black glass front (instead of a white glass front offered on silver and gold iPhone models). Similar to the fifth generation iPod Touch models, the iPhone 5C was available in five colors: blue, green, pink, yellow, and white. It was also the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features. It is also the last iPhone to include the familiar "squircle" icon on the Home button.</p>

				<li class="list-par_item">It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. It is the second most popular mobile operating system platform in the world by sales, after Android.</li>

As of January 2015, Apple's App Store contained more than 1.4 million iOS applications, 725,000 of which are native for iPads.[8] These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 100 billion times.[9]</li>
